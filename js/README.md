Online Multiplayer: Enable players to compete with others online in real-time, either by matching pairs at the same time or in a turn-based mode.

Levels of Difficulty: Provide multiple levels (e.g., easy, medium, hard), which could vary by grid size, the complexity of the card designs, or the speed of a timer.
